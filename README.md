# RigelLib

This is a collection of reusable code and utilities for C++ applications based on SDL and OpenGL, packaged as a library. Most of this was originally written for [RigelEngine](https://github.com/lethal-guitar/RigelEngine).

# How to use this

The intended way of integrating RigelLib into a project is to add the code as a git submodule, and then use CMake's `add_subdirectory` function to include it in the build.

More detailed instructions coming soon.

# What's in here?
